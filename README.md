# Cellular Automata Rust

A fun little learning project to run cellular automata.
This project is building towards a MVP set of features with extensions to really practice my Rust.

## MVP Goals:
- [ ] Fixed-size grid.
- [ ] Terminal Rendering
- [ ] Hardcoded update rate.
- [ ] Game of Life Rules.

## Extended Goals:
- [ ] "Infinite" (variable) grid size.
- [ ] GUI Rendering (Bevy? GPU Rendering?).
- [ ] Arbitrary, simple, rule definitions.
- [ ] More complex grid states/rules than just "ON" "OFF".
